* The folks at Flux have kindly set up a class Flux allocation for Stats 531.

* Using Flux is entirely optional. If you're new to Flux, but prepared to work in a Unix environment, then the online tutorial ["Flux in 10 easy steps"](http://arc-ts.umich.edu/flux/using-flux/flux-in-10-easy-steps) may indeed be not too difficult to follow, and a worthwhile investment of time.

* Flux has excellent support staff, if you have questions, but you're welcome to start by asking them to Dao or myself.

* Technical instructions about the Stats 531 Flux allocation follow:

* A 100 core allocation has been created for stats531w16_flux. 

* These cores are available now and will remain active for 1 month, through the end of the day on 5/14/2016. 

* Everyone on the Canvas email list for Stats 531 has been added as authorized users.

* For students to use this allocation, they should include the following lines into their PBS scripts:
```
#PBS -A stats531w16_flux
#PBS -l qos=flux
#PBS -q flux
```

* The available resources can be checked quickly with the `freealloc` command on Flux:  
```
freealloc stats531w16_flux
0 of 100 cores in use, 100 cores available
0 KB of 400 GB memory in use, 400 GB memory available
```   
 
* An example of doParallel use is in the example files in /scratch/data/examples/R/doParallel. Type the commands
```
$ mkdir example
$ cd example
$ cp /scratch/data/examples/R/doParallel/*  ./
```
to make local copies of the following files:
```
doParallel_example.pbs
doParallel_example.R
doParallel_example.Rout
test_R_doParallel.o19081388
```

* You have to make a few modifications to run your code.

    + In the PBS submit script,  there are instructions in the comments at the head of the file.  You need to fill in your e-mail address and Flux account name before submitting it.

    + In the R program itself, there is an example of a parallel foreach operation. This should be replaceable by the foreach code we've been using for POMP analysis.
