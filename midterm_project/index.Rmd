* Following the [class discussion](http://ionides.github.io/531w16/hw/summary06.html), projects with source code are posted anonymously on the class webpage.

* I will contact everyone to give you the opportunity to have your name attached to your project, if you like, after the course is over and the class grades are assigned.

* Here are the projects. Source code and data are available from [https://github.com/ionides/531w16/tree/master/midterm_project](https://github.com/ionides/531w16/tree/master/midterm_project).
