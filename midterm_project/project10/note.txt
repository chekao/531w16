The code will all run in R, and produce all the statistical figures and graphs without error. Try clicking on "Chunks" -> "Run All" when the rmd file is opened in R Studio. However, when I run the code in R markdown, an html is not produced and I think this is because of line 151. However, when I run line 151 in the R console, it works just fine.
