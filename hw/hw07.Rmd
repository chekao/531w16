<big><big>Midterm project mini-presentations</big></big>

* Some class time on 3/22 and 3/24 will be allocated to midterm project presentations. I'll circulate a sign-up sheet in class. Your homework this week is to prepare your presentation.

* Each student will have an allocation of 3 minutes and will be expected to have a single slide summarizing their project. 

* The slide will be submitted as a pdf file on Canvas, by midnight on Monday 3/21, so that I can set up all the presentations ahead of time on my laptop and the class can move smoothly from one presentation to the next.

* Mini presentations are a great way to advertise the main goal and results of your project. From the audience perspective, you get an overview of what everyone else has been up to.
