This homework assignment is to start planning your final project. 

You are asked to select a dataset and outline a potential analysis. This may mean, for example, writing down a model that may be used as a central component of the analysis.

There is no obligation for your final project to follow the proposal that you make in this homework.

Your proposal will not be graded. This is just an opportunity for you to get some feedback before you get down to the full data analysis and report writing.

Submit to Canvas a pdf with a plot of your data, a sentence or so to say where the data come from, and a paragraph or two outlining what you intend to do.
